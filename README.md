# 🛠️ C & C++ Programming Playground
**Author:** Maeba Derrick
**Status:** Active Development Workspace

## 🌟 About This Workspace
This folder is the primary repository for all my **C** and **C++** programming projects. It is designed to track my progress from foundational syntax to advanced software development concepts. 

Currently, it houses the **Formative Practical Assessment** completed on June 20, 2025.

## 📂 Project Directory

### 🎓 Academic Tasks (Polytechnic Assessment)
* **`Rectangle_OOP_Implementation.cpp`**: (Task 1) Implements a C++ class with default and parameterized constructors to calculate rectangle areas.
* **`Student_Grading_System.c`**: (Task 2) A C program using arrays to process subject marks and assign grades.
* **`Area_Calculator_Functions.cpp`**: (Task 3) A C++ modular program using pass-by-reference to manage rectangle dimensions.

### 🖼️ Documentation
* **`/program`**: Contains testing screenshots labeled `C` showing program execution for both valid and invalid data.

---

## ⚙️ Development Setup
To maintain consistency across all programs in this playground:
* **Compiler**: GCC/G++.
* **Indentation**: 4 spaces for readability.
* **Documentation**: Every file includes a header comment with the author's name and purpose.

## 🚀 How to Compile & Run
Navigate to this folder in your terminal (PowerShell or Git Bash) and use:

**For C++ Files:**
```powershell
g++ FileName.cpp -o program.exe ; ./program.exe
 or 

### C++ Programs (Task 1 & 3)
Compile and run using `g++`:
```powershell
g++ FileName.cpp -o app.exe ; ./app.exe

gcc FileName.c -o program.exe ; ./program.exe

### Folder Cleanup & Final Steps
1. **Rename the Files**: Go ahead and rename your `task1`, `task2`, and `task3` files to the descriptive names in the README (e.g., `Rectangle_OOP_Implementation.cpp`).
2. **Move the Screenshots**: Ensure your `C.png` (or similar) is inside the `program` folder as per the instruction in Task 2(c).
3. **The Play Button**: Since you are using VS Code, you can still just hit the "Play" button, but having the manual commands in the README shows you understand how the compiler works behind the scenes.
